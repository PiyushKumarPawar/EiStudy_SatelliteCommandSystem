# Satellite Command System

This is a simple Satellite Command System implemented in Java. The Source code is available in src folder.

## Features
 - Display State: View the current orientation, status of solar panels, and data collected by the satellite.
 - Rotate: Implement a command called 'rotate' that takes a direction parameter (North, South, East, West) and sets the satellite's
orientation accordingly.
Example: rotate(North) would set the orientation to "North".
 - Activate/Deactivate Solar Panels: Implement commands called 'activatePanels' and 'deactivatePanels' to control the solar panels'
status.
Example: activatePanels() would set the solar panels to "Active".
 -Collect Data: Implement a command called 'collectData' that increments the 'Data Collected' attribute by 10 units, but only if the solar
panels are "Active".
Example: collectData() would set the data collected to 10 if the solar panels are "Active".
 - Exit: Quit the Satellite Command System and terminate the program.
